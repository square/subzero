# Subzero

Codesafe code to perform Bitcoin wallet operations.

The code is designed to work on Mac OS X (for development purpose), as well as
nCipher. This is achieved by using glibsee.

# Electrum
Electrum is a popular, open source wallet. The code is in python and it's sometimes useful
to compare bytes with Electrum.

    git clone git://github.com/spesmilo/electrum.git
    cd electrum
    cd contrib/build-osx

    # only need to build once
    ./make_osx
    cd ../../

    # you can then edit the code in lib/ and see the changes
    ./run_electrum --testnet -v

    # see also https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/master/contrib/build-osx

# Bitcoin resources
- [Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/) is worth every penny. The book's latex source is free and you can build it yourself if you want a pdf version.
- Testnet: https://testnet.coinfaucet.eu/en/ and https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/faucet are two reliable faucets. https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/ is a testnet explorer.
- `brew install bx` is a very versatile tool.
- Bitcoin protocols are documented as [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips), or BIP for short.
- Bip39 tools: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/, https://bip32jp.github.io/english/index.html. Keep in mind that some tools don't properly handle additional or missing `/` in the derivation path!
- Useful existing projects:
  - [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/): the official full node (C++).
  - [BitcoinJ](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj): used by BitBank (Java clone)
  - [Electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum): popular wallet software

# Getting started (docker)
This will build and start subzero in docker.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/square/subzero.git
    ./subzero/core/subzero-docker.sh run

# Developing in CLion
Create a new project from this repo in CLion.
The IDE won't work properly until you hit "build", which generates proto header
files.  After you build in CLion, you may need to `File > Reload CMake Project`
for it to load the proto headers.

# Developing in Docker
See options with

    ./subzero-docker.sh help

If you want to iteratively develop in the docker container, you might want to:

    ./subzero-docker.sh dev

You now have a shell inside the container.
To rebuild:

    cd /build
    ./subzero --checks-only

You can continue to edit files outside the container, since it's a shared
filesystem with the host.

# Getting started (locally)

1. Install Hermit on your system following the instructions at [https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/).
2. Install clang using the standard installation method for your OS (google it if necessary). The clang package for hermit doesn't work properly so this is the only dependency that cannot be "hermit-ized".
3. Run the following commands:
```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/square/subzero.git
    cd subzero
    . bin/activate-hermit # not necessary if you enable hermit shell hooks
    cd core
    mkdir build
    cd build
    CURRENCY=btc-testnet cmake ../
    make
    ./subzero
```

# nCipher (without signed code)

1. Install hermit as instructed above
2. Make sure you have the proprietary ncipher libraries and cross-compiler (you need to get these from nCipher). See core/codesafe.cmake for some details. (TODO: document what versions of ncipher software are needed)
3. Run the following commands:
```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/square/subzero.git
    cd subzero
    . bin/activate-hermit # not necessary if you enable hermit shell hooks
    cd core
    mkdir build
    cd build
    TARGET=nCipher CURRENCY=btc-testnet cmake ../
    make
    make run
```
