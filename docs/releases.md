# Past and future releases
Square's security engineering team maintains Subzero. Our recommendation is to use the _master_ branch, which we
keep in a stable state. If you would like the peace of mind of using a version of Subzero which corresponds to
Square's internal release, you can refer to the table below.

Each internal release upgrades dependencies as well as fixes issues. Given the project's offline nature, each release
takes considerable amount of engineering and project management time. As a result, we prefer to perform no more than 1
release per quarter and at least one release every year.

## Backwards compatibility
Releases are usually backwards compatible but there is no such guarantee. The easiest way to resolve backwards
compatibility issues is to create a fresh wallet with the newer software and use the older version to transfer funds.

## Change log
We do not maintain a change log. The [commit log](https://github.com/square/subzero/commits/master) contains, hopefully,
clear and palpable commit messages.
