# Building and Running the code without HSMs

Subzero can be used without HSMs. This is useful for evaluation purpose as well as development. The wallet is however
not encrypted — Subzero's security model assumes you are using a HSM in your production setup.

The instructions in this page work with Mac OS X. Linux users can simply skip irrelevant parts. Windows users are
advised to use a virtualization layer (e.g. Ubuntu inside VirtualBox).

The Core is compiled using _cmake_ and _gcc_. The web server and GUI are built using _gradle_ and run with Java.
Since we don't have a HSM, we'll be using stub classes (included with Subzero) to successfully compile the
code — HSM-specific steps will then be skipped.

## Installing the tools and building the code

This section goes over the minimal set of tools needed to build and run Subzero. If you would like to develop and
contribute to Subzero, we recommend installing [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for the Java piece
and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for the C core.

(You can skip some of these steps if you prefer to use Docker instead. The command to build and run the Core is
`cd core; docker build -t subzero . && docker run -t -p 32366:32366 --name subzero subzero`. In the future, we may
provide additional docker files for running the GUI and web server).

    # Open Terminal and install Homebrew
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

    # install Java
    brew update
    brew cask install java

    # note: if Mac OS X gives you a warning about unverified developers, you can go to the
    # Security & Privacy settings and allow the action to take place.

    # install cmake
    brew install cmake

    # install protobuf
    brew install protobuf

    # close + re-open the Terminal window for some changes to take effect

    # clone the repo
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/square/subzero.git
    cd subzero

    # build the Java code
    cd java
    ./gradlew build

    # build the C code, using testnet transactions.
    cd ../core
    mkdir build
    cd build
    TARGET=dev CURRENCY=btc-testnet cmake ../
    make

    # create the wallets directory
    sudo mkdir -p /data/app/subzero/wallets/
    sudo chown $USER /data/app/subzero/wallets/
    touch /data/app/subzero/wallets/.subzero_702e63a9

## Running the servers and user interface

See also [sample output](core_sample_output.md).

    # start the core (listens on port 32366 by default)
    # when the Core starts, it runs several self checks. Some number of red lines is thus expected
    ./subzero/core/build/subzero

    # in a fresh Terminal tab, start the dev/demo server (listens on port 8080)
    java -jar ./subzero/java/server/build/libs/server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server

    # in a fresh Terminal tab, open http://localhost:8080/.
    open http://localhost:8080/

    # start the GUI
    java -jar ./subzero/java/build/libs/gui-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar

Your environment should look as following (from top left, going clockwise): the GUI, a web browser, and a Terminal.

## Creating a wallet and signing your first transaction

By default, Subzero is configured to work with 2-of-4 signatures. Creating a wallet will therefore require 4
initialization and 4 finalization steps. Broadcasting a transaction will require 2 signatures.

### Initialization

On the web browser, click on "generate QR code" under Initialize a wallet. Unless if you set a wallet id, the QR code
should be "EAAaAA==".

![Init wallet: dev server](./init_wallet_dev_server.png)

You can paste this code in the GUI, which will change the GUI to the approval step. note: the GUI currently does not
support clipboard operations. You can instead use the Terminal tab to copy-paste data.

![Init wallet: GUI](./init_wallet_gui.png)

Type "yes" + [enter] to continue. A QR code is displayed, but you can also copy the data from the Terminal. You will
want to save this response in TextEdit. In our case, the response was `CnMKcQpv3trfyO6S55vO5PLtkpjakvPNzdOb+PLe0P3O5sft4tzb55Lp2tLd5N7Fydjs4MPZ8szcn5Lkm53dyc+ewcWSweDF2snP39ub/fny2v/v7ODI8uzA0M7+/8/8meDD0M7znO3vx+ub7+aS3Z3O+sDy`. Since this response contains ciphertext, the data will be different each time.

![Init wallet: GUI done](./init_wallet_gui_done.png)

Before you can repeat the wallet initialization process 3 more times, you need to move the wallet file out of the way:

    # In a fresh Terminal tab
    cd /data/app/subzero/wallets
    mkdir initialized
    mv -n subzero-0.wallet initialized/subzero-0.wallet-1

Once you are done initializing the 4 shares, you'll have 4 files in /data/app/subzero/wallets/initialized:

![Init wallet: 4 shares](./init_wallet_initialized.png)

And 4 responses in TextEdit:

![Init wallet: 4 responses](./init_wallet_text_edit.png)

### Finalization

You can now finalize each share. Using the Finalize a wallet section in the web browser, fill out each initialize
response and click on "generate QR code". For reference, here is our data, but yours will differ:

Tp///cx9DD/ujF4uDr2vrN0O3C2N3F086S8ND42+ft2cPr0/r5
```

![Finalize wallet: dev server ](./finalize_wallet_web.png)

You can now finalize each wallet file. You will have to, one-by-one, copy wallet files from /data/app/subzero/wallets/initialized
to /data/app/subzero/wallets/ and move the result to /data/app/subzero/wallets/finalized/.

    mv -n initialized/subzero-0.wallet-1 subzero-0.wallet

![Finalize wallet: GUI](./finalize_wallet_gui.png)

Type "yes" + [enter] to continue. Again, make sure you record each response. Our response was `EnEKb3RwdWJEOE0xZE5YRzgycDhZZ2d5MVJYdHpXZExtR0h2cU04Q3B4d050b2NyRkppc1hmdjU4TjE3d2NlNGtvOGtKb3BjZXVxMVdTWHBVRUZKYlhGanpkVFVlVjNKaXpkWTZHRW1BMUVMOHc3ZFBqWA==`.

![Finalize wallet: GUI done](./finalize_wallet_gui_done.png)

Move the wallet file out of the way and finalize the remaining 3 shares.

    mv -n subzero-0.wallet finalized/subzero-0.wallet-1

Once you are done finalizing the 4 shares, you'll have 4 files in /data/app/subzero/wallets/finalized:

![Finalize wallet: Finalized](./finalize_wallet_finalized.png)

And 4 more responses in TextEdit:

![Finalize wallet: 4 responses](./finalize_wallet_text_edit.png)

### Reveal wallet xpubs

Using the 4 responses from the finalization step and the web browser, you can get the extended public keys
(`xpub` prefix for mainnet and `tpub` prefix for testnet). These public keys can be used to derive addresses and send
funds to the cold wallet.

![xpubs](./xpubs.png)

### Derive an address and send funds

Using the same 4 responses from the finalization step and the web browser, you can get addresses. Let's derive the
first non-change address. In our case, we get `2NF3qdAFLNTvC8C7kqbccndZzqU22uFAr8Z`.

![Derive wallet address](./derive_wallet_address.png)

We can send funds to this address and then use our wallet shares to sign a transaction which moves the funds out. For testnet addresses, we can use
a [faucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/), which is a free service available to Bitcoin developers to get testnet coins.

We can then see [our transaction](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/tx/1b0d4220b5c857ba5632c8418bf4ab1e0e7913c19cd7b967ee54c66fe566fdcd/) on block explorer.

### Sign a transaction

The server component of Subzero currently does not perform any kind of wallet or UTXO management. We must therefore
provide the inputs and desired outputs. For our first transaction, we'll use the funding transaction as our sole input
and send all the funds (minus the fee) to the gateway.

Using the web browser, we get the following signing request `EAAqTQovCiAbDUIgtchXulYyyEGL9KseDnkTwZzXuWfuVMZv5Wb9zRABGLTdpAQiBBAAGAASDQiU0J4EEAIaBBAAGAAYACIAKQAAAAAAAAAA`.

![First transaction](./first_transaction.png)

We'll need to use any two wallet shares to sign this transaction.

    mv -n finalized/subzero-0.wallet-1 subzero-0.wallet

![SignTx GUI](./sign_tx_gui.png)

Resulting in a signing response. Repeat the process with another wallet share to get two responses (our threshold).

Use the web browser to merge these signatures into a transaction.

Our final transaction is:
